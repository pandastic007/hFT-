This is the architecture that I used for preprocessing my Augmented Studio Maestro data, a small part of it on Google Colab.

More about the original architecture of the model here : Toyama, K., Akama, T., Ikemiya, Y., Takida, Y., Liao, W.-H., & Mitsufuji, Y. (2023).

I just made it so I can use it in Google Colab.
As part of my thesis paper - "Research on Machine Learning Methods for Audio to Music Notes Transcription"
